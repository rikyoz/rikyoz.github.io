My journey into the cyber universe began when I was 10 years old, and I started to be fascinated by the world of computers and, in particular, programming. I realized very fast that computer science would be my passion, and I soon decided to pursue a career in this field.
<br/>
Throughout all these years, I <a href="#skills" title="My Skills"><strong>learned to use many programming languages</strong></a> and <a href="#projects" title="My Projects"><strong>created several personal projects</strong></a> (<em>some</em> listed <a href="#projects" title="My Projects">below</a>).
In addition to this, I felt the need to systematize, consolidate, and expand my knowledge about computer science. Therefore, I decided to take a university degree course, and I recently <a href="#education" title="My Education"><strong>graduated in Engineering in Computer Science (Master's Degree) with honors</strong></a>.
<br/>
I am a <strong>fast learner</strong>, <strong>highly motivated</strong>, and <strong>hard-working</strong>, always willing to learn new skills to enhance my abilities.
<br/>
As time went by, I developed an interest in every aspect of computer science. Still, I am particularly focused and passionate about <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, <strong>software development</strong>, <strong>design best practices</strong>, and <strong>secure and clean code principles</strong>.
