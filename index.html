My journey into the cyber universe began when I was 10 years old, and I started to be fascinated by the world of computers and, in particular, programming. I realized very fast that computer science would be my passion, and I soon decided to pursue a career in this field.
<br/>
Throughout all these years, I <strong>learned to use many programming languages</strong> and <strong>created several personal projects</strong> (<em>some</em> listed <a href="#projects" title="My Projects">below</a>).
In addition to this, I felt the need to systematize, consolidate, and expand my knowledge about computer science. Hence, I decided to take a university degree course, and I recently <strong>graduated in Engineering in Computer Science (Master's Degree) with honors</strong>.
<br/>
I am a <strong>fast learner</strong>, <strong>highly motivated</strong>, and <strong>hard-working</strong>, always willing to learn new skills to enhance my abilities.
<br/>
I am interested in every aspect of computer science and particularly passionate about <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, <strong>software development</strong>, <strong>secure and clean coding</strong>.
